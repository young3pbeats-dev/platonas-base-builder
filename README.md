**Type:** Educational Automated Market Maker (DeFi prototype)

A minimal Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed to demonstrate core DeFi mechanics on Base Mainnet.  
Implements a tokenA/tokenB liquidity pool using the constant product formula (x * y = k), enabling basic swaps, liquidity additions, withdrawals, and event tracking for pool operations.

Purpose: Provide a clear technical showcase of AMM fundamentals within the Platonas Base Builder portfolio.

## 🔹TimeLockedAccount

**Network:** Base Mainnet 
**Address:** https://basescan.org/address/0xeE0Ce321398D010c8E1deB99f33966480b596bA7
**Type:** Time-Locked Vault / Account Abstraction Utility

A minimal time-locked smart contract designed to securely hold ETH and ERC20 tokens until a predefined unlock timestamp.
Funds deposited into the contract remain inaccessible until the unlockTime condition is met, after which withdrawals can be executed by the owner or a designated beneficiary.

The contract supports native ETH deposits via receive() and ERC20 deposits via explicit approval, making it suitable for delayed payouts, vesting-like mechanisms, escrow-style flows, and self-custodial time-based fund management on Base Mainnet.

Purpose: Provide a clean and practical example of time-lock mechanics and secure conditional withdrawals within the Platonas Base Builder portfolio.

## 🔹 CrossChainPriceFeed.sol
**Network:** Base Mainnet  
**Address:** https://basescan.org/address/0x24C1c6a115Ed12Cd3Fe0d2E8e4d27525ed1A1b57  

A minimal oracle-style contract that allows manual, role-based price updates to simulate cross-chain data feeds on Base Mainnet.

Designed to demonstrate oracle architecture, authorization patterns, and clean data access, while remaining compatible with future integrations such as CCIP, LayerZero, or custom relayers.

Core features:
- Manual oracle-based price updates  
- Role-based authorization for feed updates  
- Timestamped price storage (stale data protection)  
- Multi-asset feed support (e.g. ETH/USD, BTC/USD)  
- Source chain context via `sourceChainId`  

Reason: Oracles are the backbone of DeFi. This contract demonstrates real-world architecture beyond simple storage primitives while remaining honest about off-chain data delivery.

🔹 PriceFeedRegistry.sol ⚙️

**Network:** Base Mainnet
**Address:** (https://basescan.org/address/0x9DdB82a4855B5fD73D9F12b2348E9AEb217D7FF5)
**Type:** Advanced Oracle Registry / Price Feed Aggregator

📌 Overview

PriceFeedRegistry is a modular on-chain registry designed to manage multiple oracle price submissions per asset and compute a median-based aggregated price, improving resistance against manipulation and single-oracle failure.

The contract is built as a core oracle primitive for future extensions such as reputation-weighted oracles, staking-based oracle incentives, and cross-chain price relayers.

🔹 UpgradeablePriceFeed.sol ⚙️

**Network:**  Base Mainnet
**Address:** https://basescan.org/address/0xd3923708eaF94bbaF48999a3dA61ab92c0E92666
**Type:** Upgradeable Oracle / UUPS Price Feed

A minimal upgradeable price feed contract built using the UUPS proxy pattern, designed to store and serve on-chain price data while preserving the ability to evolve logic over time without breaking state or integrations.

The contract allows the owner to update a stored price value, emitting events for transparency, while consumers can read the latest price directly from the proxy address.
Upgrade authorization is strictly controlled via ownership, ensuring safe and explicit upgrade paths.

Core features:
	•	UUPS upgradeable architecture (OpenZeppelin)
	•	Proxy-based state persistence
	•	Owner-controlled price updates
	•	Clean separation between logic and storage
	•	Upgrade-ready for future oracle extensions

Use cases include educational oracle demos, upgradeable infrastructure primitives, and experimentation with safe smart contract upgrade patterns on Base Mainnet.

Purpose: Demonstrate correct implementation of upgradeable smart contracts and oracle-style data access within the Platonas Base Builder portfolio, going beyond static deployments and highlighting real-world upgrade flows.

🔹 CrossChainOracleReceiver.sol 

**Network:** Base Mainnet  
**Address:** https://basescan.org/address/0x89E2AB9bD3106Ff3bA17588EB1cfb6Cd9A2c1Ff3  
**Type:** Oracle Receiver / Cross-chain Architecture Demo

A minimal oracle receiver designed to simulate cross-chain price updates on Base Mainnet.  
Stores a price value with timestamp, enforces oracle-only updates, and includes stale-price protection via a configurable maxDelay.

Purpose: Demonstrate clean oracle architecture, authorization patterns, and price freshness validation for portfolio-grade DeFi primitives.

🔹 ReputationWeightedOracle.sol 

**Network:**  Base Mainnet
**Address:** https://basescan.org/address/0x42A75b786F3370Eac2F671c88377D92C80c80589
**Type:** Reputation-Weighted Oracle / Data Aggregation Primitive

📌 Overview

ReputationWeightedOracle is a minimal on-chain oracle designed to aggregate values from authorized sources using reputation-based weighting.

Each source contributes to the final aggregated value proportionally to its assigned reputation score, providing a simple and deterministic alternative to median-based aggregation.

The contract serves as a core oracle primitive for trust-aware data feeds and future extensions such as reputation decay, slashing, or governance-controlled oracle systems.
